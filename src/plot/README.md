# Accompanying Plots

Plots and assocated data are presented within this folder.

As December 2021, the plotting code requires installation of `seaborn` directly from GitHub to propoerly plot error bars with two standard deviations. Installing `seaborn` from a earlier release (v 0.11) will not allow these plots to run withe appropriate error bars. 

To run the plotting code, install the dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We have provided the plots as both a Python script, `Plot_Notebook.py` and as a Jupyter notebook, `Plot_Notebook.ipynb`.  The script is a copy of the notebook eexported as a Python script.
