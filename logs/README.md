This directory contains the logs for all of the experiments we included in the paper:

* The results for VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10 are those that we included in Section 2 of the main paper (with expanded results in the Supplementary Material)
* The LSTM Wikitext2 logs and related figures are in the Supplementary Material 
* The defense logs correspond to the Defense section (Section 5) of our paper
